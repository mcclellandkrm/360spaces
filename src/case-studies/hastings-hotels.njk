        <h2>Project Overview</h2>
        <p>{{ client }} collaborated with 360spaces to showcase their luxury hotel properties through immersive virtual
          experiences. This comprehensive digital solution allows potential guests to explore rooms, amenities, and facilities in
          stunning detail before making their booking decision.</p>
        <p>The virtual tours capture the elegance and unique character of each {{ client }} property, from historic charm to
          modern luxury, providing an authentic preview that builds excitement and confidence in their booking choice.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="luxury-content-section">
        <h2>The Challenge</h2>
        <p>In the competitive hospitality market, {{ client }} needed to differentiate their properties and reduce booking
          uncertainty. Traditional photos couldn't convey the true atmosphere, scale, and luxury feel of their venues.</p>
        <p>They required a solution that would showcase their properties' unique selling points, reduce booking anxiety, and
          ultimately increase direct reservations while decreasing reliance on third-party booking platforms.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="luxury-content-section">
        <h2>Our Solution</h2>
        <p>We developed immersive virtual experiences that showcase {{ client }}'s hospitality excellence:</p>
        <ul class="luxury-feature-list">
          <li>Room-by-room virtual tours with multiple accommodation options</li>
          <li>Interactive exploration of dining venues and leisure facilities</li>
          <li>Integration with booking systems for seamless reservations</li>
          <li>Mobile-responsive design for travel planning on any device</li>
          <li>Multi-language support for international guests</li>
