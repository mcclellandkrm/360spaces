        <h2>Project Overview</h2>
        <p>{{ client }} partnered with 360spaces to create an immersive retail experience that brings their flagship store
          online. This innovative virtual tour allows customers to browse products, explore different departments, and get a
          genuine feel for the store atmosphere before visiting in person.</p>
        <p>The virtual tour seamlessly integrates with their e-commerce platform, creating a bridge between digital browsing and
          physical retail that enhances the customer journey at every touchpoint.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="luxury-content-section">
        <h2>The Challenge</h2>
        <p>{{ client }} needed to compete with online retailers while leveraging their physical store advantage. Traditional
          product photos and descriptions weren't conveying the quality and variety of their sports equipment and clothing ranges.</p>
        <p>They required a solution that would showcase their extensive product displays, create an engaging online experience,
          and drive more qualified foot traffic to their physical locations.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="luxury-content-section">
        <h2>Our Solution</h2>
        <p>We created a comprehensive virtual retail experience that highlights {{ client }}'s competitive advantages:</p>
        <ul class="luxury-feature-list">
          <li>Interactive product showcases with detailed 360° views</li>
          <li>Department-by-department navigation mimicking in-store browsing</li>
          <li>Integration with inventory management for real-time availability</li>
          <li>Mobile-optimized interface for on-the-go shopping</li>
          <li>Social sharing features to amplify reach</li>
